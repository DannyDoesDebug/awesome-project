# GitConnect
The Portfolio Platform for Devs

## Show the world what you’re building

GitConnect is a dedicated platform for developers to build their portfolio, connect with opportunities, and with each other.

## Create your developer portfolio in minutes, not days.

Ever had a family member or significant other ask what you actually do for work, and haven't been able to provide a satisfying answer? Now you can show them GitConnect.

Integrate with GitHub, import your projects with just a few clicks, and create a customised portfolio that you can share with potential employers, colleagues, or even your mom.

## Your code, visualised.

Visual communication is one of the most efficient languages on earth, coding communication is one of the most complex languages on earth.

We want to bridge this gap and help you translate your code into a narrative, a visual showcase of your work that does justice to the amount of commits you put in to it.

## More than a portfolio, a community.

Your GitConnect portfolio is yours to own, edit and share. It’s a home within a home, surrounded by the GitConnect community. Explore what your peers are creating - find inspiration for your next passion project, or connect with collaborators for a future venture.

## Nurture potential, spark innovation

Our mission at GitConnect is to foster innovation through creating a community-driven space for devs to inspire other devs. We hope to fuel your creativity, champion your novel ideas, and provide a natural home for you to display what you build - to help ensure the results are found by the people who could get value of them.

## All builders are welcome.

Devs are capable of incredible things and we want to give you a place to share whatever your ‘incredible thing’ might be. Whether you are a budding developer looking to create a professional presence online or a seasoned software engineer wanting to showcase your magnum opus -GitConnect is for you.

## If you have ideas, we want to hear them.

We're in the early stages, but our future is ambitious. Our goal is to help developers find a community and meaningful work. We plan to release more tools to inspire, connect, and accelerate the careers of software engineers.

Join the Discord and tell us what you think, what should we be focussed on, or what needs to be improved - our users are our stakeholders and we want to align our goals to yours.
